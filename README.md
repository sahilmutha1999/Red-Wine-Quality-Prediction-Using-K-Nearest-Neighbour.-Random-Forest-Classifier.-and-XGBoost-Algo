# Red Wine Quality Prediction Using KNN, Random Forest and XGBoost Algorithms

This repository is based on a project titled "Red Wine Quality Prediction", wherein I have used "Red Wine Quality" dataset from Kaggle.
In this project, I have predicted the accuracy at which KNN, Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms can predict the quality of red wine based on different factors like alcoholic rate, sulfur dioxide, residual sugar, etc.
